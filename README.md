  ## 🔍 Overview

 This is a JavaScript project with a React frontend and a Tailwind CSS backend, using Vite as the build tool and ESLint for code linting. The project includes a `package.json` file for managing dependencies, a `tailwind.config.js` file for configuring Tailwind, and a `vite.config.js` file for configuring Vite. The project also includes a `src` directory with source code for the frontend and backend, including a `main.jsx` file for the main entry point of the application, a `calculator.jsx` file for the calculator component, an `index.css` file for styling the application, and a `calc.css` file for styling the calculator component. Additionally, there is a `.gitignore` file to ignore certain files and directories from Git version control, a `postcss.config.js` file for configuring PostCSS, and a `yarn.lock` file for locking down dependencies.
